# Online Book Store

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an Online Book Store application, implemented step by step. The app will feature several domain models/entities:

- **User**: Contains registered user information, including authentication details and personal information.
- **Role**: Represents user roles within the system, such as admin or regular user.
- **Book**: Represents books available in the store.
- **Category**: Represents book categories.
- **ShoppingCart**: Represents a user's shopping cart.
- **CartItem**: Represents items in a user's shopping cart.
- **Order**: Represents orders placed by users.
- **OrderItem**: Represents items in a user's order.

This is an overview of the project that will be implemented gradually throughout this module. The project will be divided into parts. Create a new GitHub repository for this project, which you can later share in your CV as proof of your work for potential interviewers.
